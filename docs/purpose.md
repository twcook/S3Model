# Purpose

S3Model is an open source project developed to provide a minimalistic, sustainable, interoperable, and implementable approach to data modeling. 

The project offers a comprehensive set of tools for data modeling that allow users to create models that are compatible with multiple data sources and applications. It also offers a highly interoperable framework for data model creation that is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to quickly implement their models for data sharing.

Using S3Model, developers can easily create data models that are both sustainable and implementable. The project provides an intuitive interface for creating models, and the models can be stored in a secure repository that can be accessed from anywhere. Moreover, the models are easily sharable across multiple data sources and applications, ensuring that the data remains up-to-date and secure. This makes S3Model an ideal choice for data providers and data consumers who need to quickly exchange data models.
