# S3Model Summary

S3Model is designed as a foundational approach to solving the problem of understanding and sharing information across different systems and areas. Its core goal is to make data **shareable, structured, and semantic**, moving away from the legacy approach where data context is often locked within specific applications.

The system uses a multi-level modeling approach. At its base is the **Reference Model (RM)**, which provides a small set of concepts for building structures without including specific domain meaning. Building on this, **Data Models (DMs)** are created.

These DMs are often created by **domain experts** â€“ individuals with specialized knowledge in a particular field. The sources state that DMs are created by domain experts to model concepts in their specific domains, which can include healthcare. The examples of a meteorologist designing a weather data model and a physician designing a healthcare concept model were provided in our conversation history, consistent with this concept. The domain expert adds specific rules and semantics (meaning) to the data structures defined in the RM. This allows their expert knowledge to be encoded into a computable model.

By using this system, S3Model makes data instances **Shareable**, gives them a clear **Structured** form, and includes the necessary **Semantic** meaning so computers can understand them. This helps improve data quality and makes it easier to use data for important tasks like decision-making.
