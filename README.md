Shareable-Structured-Semantic Model (S3Model)
=============================================

Introducing **S3Model**, an open-source solution for cross-domain data interoperability. Our solution is built on the foundation of the ubiquitous XML Schema data model, leveraging the power of semantics and shared data models to enable seamless integration between different systems and industries.

Utilizing the powerful technologies such as OWL and RDF, S3Model enhances the semantic understanding of the data, allowing for accurate communication and data sharing across various domains. With our cutting-edge approach using proven technology, S3Model bridges the gap between incompatible data formats, enabling efficient and accurate data processing.

S3Model offers a flexible and sharable data model that can be used across multiple domains and industries, ensuring consistency and reducing the need for manual data transformation. It also allows you to output the data in GraphML format which is popular in graph visualization.

Join our open-source community and contribute to the development of S3Model. Together, we can revolutionize the way data is shared and processed, improving efficiency and driving innovation. Download S3Model today and start experiencing the benefits of cross-domain data interoperability."
